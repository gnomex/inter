Instructions:

We need your help to review the code that the Marketing team has created. They need to deliver this page to the CMNH today, therefore they need your support on that.

The main points are:

1. Integrate with the backend that you have created
2. Review and make sure that the React code style is ok
3. At the last moment our main Senior Front engineer has dropped the ball and now we need you to create the filter. At the top of the page, right side, there is a form to filter projects by name. Please make it work.
4.The footer is not quite well...Could you help on that? We need you to redesign the footer and apply all your knowledge to let it adorable.
5. Please paginate the projects.
6. Lastly, feel free to bring any idea on how to improve the CSS.

May the code be with you!
